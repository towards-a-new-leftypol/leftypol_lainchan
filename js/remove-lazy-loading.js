/*
 * remove-lazy-loading.js - Removes lazy loading from thread reply images to force them to eagerly load. 
 * Lazy loading of images helps render threads quicker, but this means that images will only be loaded on scroll.
 * This impacts the user experience in a negative way since they will often see blank images when scrolling 
 * while the thumbnails load. This js solves this problem by allowing images to deferred and loaded lazily, 
 * and once everything has loaded, eagerly load the images at once by removing the lazy attribute.
